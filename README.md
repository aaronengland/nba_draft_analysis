# NBA Draft Analysis

#### Purpose
This analysis examined how NBA career outcomes vary by draft position by summarizing historical performance and longevity metrics across overall draft picks.

#### Methods
NBA draft and career data were scraped from Basketball-Reference.com for drafts between 1989 and 2015. Drafts prior to 1989 were excluded due to inconsistent draft structures with more than two rounds. The 2015 draft was used as the endpoint to allow adequate time for career outcomes to mature. Player performance and longevity metrics were aggregated by overall draft pick, and summary statistics were computed to assess how career outcomes vary across draft positions.

#### Results

#### Discussion
NBA career outcomes decline steadily with draft position across all metrics examined. Earlier picks are associated with longer careers, greater on-court production, and a much higher likelihood of elite outcomes, while later picks show sharply reduced averages and increased uncertainty. Taken together, these results help explain why teams often prioritize proven players over future draft capital—particularly outside the top of the draft—where expected returns drop quickly and become increasingly volatile.
